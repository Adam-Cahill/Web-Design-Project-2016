			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>

			<p>My name is Adam Cahill I am nineteen years old and I am currently studying computing in 
				The National College of Ireland or (NCI) for short. I attended Oatlands Primary school from 2001 - 2009,
				I also attended Oatlands College from 2009 - 2015, I then repeated the Leaving Certificate as I was not satisfied with my results.
				When people ask me if it was worth it I say yes as I was able to improve my results by seventy points and this allowed me to
				get into the computing course that I am currently enroled in.</p>
			<p>I have a strong interest in music,gaming,film,drama and sports such as football and golf.
				My favourite football team is Arsenal FC as I love their style of play. My favourite type of music would be 
				House or Electric as I simply love the sound of the beats that the music producer's/DJ's create. Some of my favourite artists would 
				include Deadmau5, David Guetta, Avicii, Tiesto and Sweedish House Mafia. I am also planning on going to 
				Tomorrowland next year as it has been my dream to attend the best music festival on earth.</p>

				<p>I love to play video games some of my favourite video games are Destiny,FIFA,Battlefield
				and of course Call of Duty or COD for short. I have been playing video games since I can remember.
				The first video game I ever played Ape Escape and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Another game that I really enjoyed was Spyro it was one of the best games I had ever played.
				The final game that I remember very fondly from my Childhood is Crash Bandicoot and it was an absolute blast to play.
