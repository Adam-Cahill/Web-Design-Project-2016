			<h1>Gaming!</h1>
			<p> I have been an avid gamer ever since I can remember, as I mentioned previously the first games I had ever played were
			Ape Escape, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot and they were unbelieveable. Ever since that day I have played video games. From pokemon in the early 
			2000's and Gears of War in 2007 to Battlefield 1 in 2016.

			<p> I am currently playing multiple games at this time and they are Destiny, Battlefield 1,
			FIFA 17 and Rainbow Six Siege. I am in the top five percent of people for PvP on Destiny.
			I am also in the top fifteen percent for skill level in battlefield 1. I have played every Call of Duty to date 
			and having discovered Call of Duty it has opened my eyes to the world of first person shooters 
			and in doing so has made me hooked on them ever since.
			<p> I also play some third person shooters as well some of these games include Gears of War (1,2 and 3), Deadspace (1,2 and 3) and The Last of us 
			which isin't reallly a third person shooter but more of a survival horror with some elements of third person shooting.
			<h2> Some of the Games I'm looking Foward To!</h2>
			<p>There are only a few games that I am looknig foward to and they are Mass Effect: Andromeda, Horizon Zero Dawn, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands
			and The new God of War. I am mainly looking foward to Horizon Zero Dawn as I don't think that I have played anything like it before and so I am looking 
			foward to doing something new and trying to different techniques in taking something out.
			<p>The plot of Horizon Zero Dawn revolves around Aloy, a hunter and archer who lives in a world overrun by robots. Having been cloistered her whole life, she sets out to discover the dangers that kept her sheltered for so long.
			The character makes use of ranged, melee weapons and stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures whose remains can also be looted for resources. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, 
			divided into tribes that hold side quests to accomplish while the main story guides her throughout the whole world.
