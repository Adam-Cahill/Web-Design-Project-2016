			<p> One of my favourite pastimes is to do some for of sport, my favourite sport is football as I have played it since I was seven years old.
			I first started playing football for Mount Merrion FC and I really enjoyed it as I was playing with my friends from Primary School at the time.
			In my first season with Mount Merrion FC I had won the "double" that is winning the league and the cup. As the years went on I eventually left Mount Merrion FC 
			after eight years of playing for them and joined Lakelands FC and there I won the Sunday League premier division and as I turned eighteen I decided that it was time to "hang up the boots"
			and move on to better things, so I took up golf and I have been loving it. It is a great way to relax and spend time with people I would normally play with family members mopre than others as I 
			find it much more easier to relax and concentrate on my game.
			<p> I have been a member of Woodbrook Golf Club since 2010 and that is where my family is also. My Dad has been a member there since
			2000.

			<p> When  am not playing/partaking in sport  like to follow them instead. My favourite football team is Arsenal FC, I follow Arsenal because
			I like there style of play and the way they are able to move the ball simply and effectively past teams of high standard. Unffortunately Arsenal have not been 
			very fortunate over the recent years in terms of silverware and key players leaving for big lump sums of money, but I'm stiil staying loyal to the
			club I love. I also follow the Irish Rugby team.
